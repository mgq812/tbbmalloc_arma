LPManager
=========

Custom memory manager 'tbbmalloc for arma' prefers memory in large page regions (requires a 64bit OS and at least 8GB RAM). 
Large pages are 2MB blocks of continous physical RAM, aligned to a 2MB boundary address.

Memory in large pages is faster to access, because the efficiency of the cpu's small TLB's (translation look-aside buffer),
is significantly higher, compared with access to small pages.  

To allocate memory in large pages, your application needs a special privilege (SeLockMemoryPrivilege) AND
your operating system need to have enough large pages available, to be able to satisfy your applications request.

Experienced user are able to do the required task, with the help of available professional system tools.

For unexperienced users it is hard to ensure this two conditions above are always met.

I made LPManager, to safe you some of the most difficult tasks, like setting privilegs up correctly
and keeping your OS in a performance-capable state.


How to use:

- find out the name of user account, that is used to run arma (start arma, start taskmanager and look for 'taskmanager'->'processes'->'User Name')

- put LPManager.exe in A3 root folder, run it via 'Run as administrator' and type your useraccountname in the white box to the right from 'Privilege' button     

- click 'Privilege' button, there should occure 'ReBoot!' in the box, in green letters

- check the CheckBox 'LP ImageFileMapping Client' (if not already checked) to apply the GMF registry tweak for arma3.exe (client)

- optional, check the CheckBox 'DisablePagingExecutive' (if not already checked) to apply a registry tweak that reduces meory fragmentation

- restart your system once     

- if you like, you can use LPManager from now on under normal user account, to check and optimize the availability of large pages on your system      


Notice:
To disable GMF tweak, for example for benchmarking purposes, just use LPManager ('run as Administrator') and uncheck the related CheckBox accordingly.





IMPORTANT (for experienced users):

Mapping imagefile in large page region, normally doesn't work for arma3server.exe (crash at start), 
because a special flag in servers imagefile header is incompatible with 'UseLargePages'.
It is possible to make lp image file mapping working, for arma server too, if this flag is patched. 
Normally, you have to use 'explorer suite' for such patching.
LPManager is able to apply the required 'DLLCharakteristics' patch in ImageFileHeader and to set the GMF registry tweak for arma3server.exe too. 
To use this feature, just check the related CheckBox.
This implies disabling of ASLR (adress space layout randomization) too, for arma 3 server. 
So please use this only, if you know what this means and what you do!
